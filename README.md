## Project 1: House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using regression techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and square footage. Different regression algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests are employed to predict the house prices accurately.

## Project 2: Avia Ticket Price Prediction

The Avia Ticket Price Prediction project aims to predict ticket prices for flights. It involves analyzing a dataset with information about various flight attributes, such as the departure and arrival locations, dates, and times, as well as additional factors like airline, class, and demand. Regression models are implemented to forecast ticket prices, enabling travelers to make informed decisions and plan their trips efficiently.
